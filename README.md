# Nazario Software System Extensions

I often make system extensions in Swift, often to do things that should be built into the framework (`eraseToAnyView()`) or to Combine-ify a callback-based API. 

Instead of copying those files from project to project, I've collected them here in one easy-to-install Swift package. This way, my logic can be shared between projects and be tested separately from any individual app's code. 

I've made the repo public so other people can see how I'm tinkering with the system. I hope it helps, especially if you're like me and love using Combine.
